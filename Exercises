1 Load the Gross Domestic Product data for the 190 ranked countries in this data set: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FGDP.csv 

Remove the commas from the GDP numbers in millions of dollars and average them. What is the average? 

Original data sources: http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/GDP-ranking-table
377652.4
379596.5
293700.3
381615.4

solution:
gdp=read.csv("gdp.csv")
gidipi=gdp[5:194,5]
	
gidipi=gidipi[gidipi!=".."&gidipi!=""]  
## fixing  character   sub(",","",gidipi) not  good  removes only the   first "," 
gidipi_without_comma=gsub(",","",gidipi)
 
mean(as.numeric(gidipi_without_comma))

2 In the data set from Question 2 what is a regular expression that would allow you to count the number of countries whose name begins with "United"? Assume that the variable with the country names in it is named countryNames. How many countries begin with United?
 solution:

grep("^United",countryNames), 3

Original data sources: 
http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/GDP-ranking-table 
http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats
Solution:

edu=read.csv("edu.csv")
fiscal=grep("(.*)Fiscal(.*)June(.*)",edu[,10])## regexpr for  Fiscal and June  because for kosovo(111) appears june   but for independence day
edu_june=edu[fiscal,1]
i=intersect(gidipi[,1],edu_june)
length(i)

4)You can use the quantmod (http://www.quantmod.com/) package to get historical stock prices for publicly traded companies on the NASDAQ and NYSE. Use the following code to download data on Amazon's stock price and get the times the data was sampled.
library(quantmod)
amzn = getSymbols("AMZN",auto.assign=FALSE)
sampleTimes = index(amzn) 
How many values were collected in 2012? How many values were collected on Mondays in 2012?
Solution:
trades=grep("(.*)2012(.*)",sampleTimes)
length(trades)
trades2012=sampleTimes[trades]
trades2012formated=format(trades2012,"%a %b %d")
trades_monday=grep("(.*)Mon(.*)",trades2012formated)
length(trades_monday)
