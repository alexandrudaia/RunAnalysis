###Author  Daia Alexandru . daia.alexandr@gmail.com

* In order to   run succesfully  the run_analysys  script  you   should  first download the  data   for
werable  computing  from :
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

* After that  you  should  unzip   the data and  set    your  R workspace  to  the main folder  of  the unziped  data
  who is  ,, UCI  HAR  Dataset"
* You  should run  the  script  in order  to see  the  result  in  many   ways   but  it is  preferable  in the  next    way: 
  - you  will use  a     console  variable  called tidy_mean or  what    other name you wan't
  - you   will store   in this  variable  the  result  of   runing  the  script   by typing :
  - ,,tidy_mean=run_analysis.R()"
  
*  You could   use   View(tidy_mean) to  visualize  the result
*  you should  see something  like  in the link    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I4X51Mznair34rjjRE-gDUjxgf_DpdIaCzBnibp8sz4/edit?usp=sharing

Good luck!!!:)
