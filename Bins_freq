Hey Sina,
This is because R uses an algorithm to define the breaks or number of BINs based on the data set. So, even if you give 10 , it is quite likely that R may use 8 BINs or any other number of BINs based on the algorithm it follows. 

The question in assignment asks for 10 BINs. Inorder for R to use exactly the number of BINs you want and override its internal algorithm of calculating the number of BINs, you must define the breaks as a sequence. Remember BINs is equivalent to the interval and breaks is the boundaries. So, 10 BINs (intervals) would mean 11 breaks or vice versa. 

So, here is an example you could use ..here we have defined the break as a sequence. In the sequence, we have also defined the min value of the range, the maximum value of range and the total boundaries we need within that range.
breaks = seq(min(e$V1), max(e$V1), l=11)

hist(iris$V1,breaks = seq(min(e$V1), max(e$V1), l=11))                                    # where l= number of boundaries giving l-1 BINs

$counts should now give you 10 frequencies which you can use for the answer. Make sure that you type the frequencies versus copying and pasting them.

I hope this would help.
